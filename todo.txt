This list of missing features and bugs is meant as a starting point
for people who wish to contribute to this project.
I'll add a note if somebody is already working on a project to
avoid duplicate work.

- add thread synchronization (mutexes) to RegistrationTable
  and CallTable

- we need a GUI client to visualize the status messages 
  (partly done; see gkkdeclient, but needs much improvement)

- Registration timeout (easy)
  add a command line option to limit time an endpoint registration
  is valid, so endpoints have to send updates, so we know they are alive
  Outline how to implement:
  - add a time filed to the RegistrationTable
  - add commandline option to specify the value in the timeToLive filed
    of every RCF (DONE)
  - update time in RegistrationTable on IRR from endpoint
  - periodically remove endpoints that we haven't heard of

- manual registration and deregistration via the status thread

- Implement H.245 signal routing (commandline option)
  Redirect all H.245 connections to gatekeeper and start another thread
  for each connection.
  H.245 routing only works when H.225 routing is active.
  The GK replaces all H.245 addresses the endpoints inserts into the H.225
  messages with addresses on his own machine and starts a new thread thats
  listening on that port and forwards the packets just like we do with H.225
  packets.

- implement LDAP access

- The resourceManager should use the new CallTable and don't keep
  it's on list of resource allocations.

- currently we only use the first alias of each endpoint; we should
  use all and keep a list in EndpointRec
