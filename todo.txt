This list of missing features and bugs is meant as a starting point
for people who wish to contribute to this project.
I'll add a note if somebody is already working on a project to
avoid duplicate work.

- fix: the ACF event signalled by PrintCurrentCalls should match
  the format of the regular ACF (needed for gkgui)

- debug: Genaration of CallProceeding messages is broken. The current
  version forwards the CallProceeding messages generated by the endpoints.
  To get the broken version compile with -D GENERATE_CALL_PROCEEDING

- add a check to CDR generation if the call actually succeeded,
  don't generate a CDR if the call wasn't accepted

- debug: call forwarding with ohphone (using Facility message)
  doesn't work in GK routed-mode. User-User info n Facility
  seems corrupt.

- debug: problems with FastStart in routed mode (eg. Siemens LP 5100
  or Netergy adapter)

- implement gatekeeper performed H.450.2 Call Transfer ?
  gatekeeper routed, gatekeeper transparent mode works already

- load testing: how many concurrent calls can be made with the
  gatekeeper on what hardware ? how does the memory requirement
  grow ? when is the slowdown to high ?

- add thread synchronization (mutexes) to RegistrationTable
  and CallTable (partially DONE)

- we need a GUI client to visualize the status messages (Java GUI started)

- manual registration via the status thread (might be needed for
  H.323 endpoints without gatekeeper support)

- Implement H.245 signal routing (command line option)
  Redirect all H.245 connections to gatekeeper and start another thread
  for each connection.
  H.245 routing only works when H.225 routing is active.
  The GK replaces all H.245 addresses the endpoints inserts into the H.225
  messages with addresses on his own machine and starts a new thread thats
  listening on that port and forwards the packets just like we do with H.225
  packets. (Take a look at the source for OpenGatekeeper to see how this
  can be implemented!)

- implement LDAP access

- The resourceManager should use the new CallTable and don't keep
  it's on list of resource allocations.
