How to compile the OpenH323 Gatekeeper
======================================

To build the gatekeeper you need at least PWlib 1.1.33 and
OpenH323 1.5.5 or later.
You can put the gatekeeper code into a subdirectory of openh323
or set the PWLIBDIR and OPENH323DIR environment variables and place
the gatekeeper code anywhere you want.

Order of compiling:
1. pwlib (release + debug version)
2. openh323
3. openh323 test application (not needed, just to make sure everything works so far)
4. gatekeeper

On Unix do a "make debug" or "make opt" in the gatekeeper directory.
Your gcc should not be too old, because we use some STL features
(egcs-2.91.66 for example is too old).

On Windows just compile the provided project for Visual C++ 6.0 (Visual C++ 5.0 is too old!).
