The Gatekeeper Status Thread
============================

The status thread is the external interface to the gatekeeper.
The gatekeeper sends out messages about ongoing calls to all
connected clients and can receive commands via the thread.

To connect to the status thread, clients open a TCP connection
to port 7000. (You can use netcat as a very simple client:
"nc <hostname> 7000".)

The future message format is described in GkStatusMsgFmt.html.

The following commands can be sent to the gatekeeper via the
status thread:
"PrintAllRegistrations"		prints all registered endpoints
"PrintCurrentCalls"			prints all ongoing calls
"DisconnectIp <IP>"			will disconnect the call on this endpoint
"DisconnectAlias <Alias>"	will disconnect the call on this endpoint
"UnregisterAllEndpoints"	will unregister all endpoints
"UnregisterAlias <Alias>"	will unregister this endpoint

See GkStatus.cxx for more commands.
