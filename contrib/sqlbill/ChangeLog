  * BUGFIX: active flag for old voiptariff aparently did not work - all tariffs
    were counted as active
  * Billing unit configurable (previously it was fixed to 60 seconds). Now it is
    possible to even to create tariffs for one-time event billing (initialincrement
    set to 60 and regular increment set 0)
  * Tariff engine redesigned - now a single tariff consists of three 
    components: destination info (prefix), the actual tariff (pricing)
	and an optional tariff group. Now is possible to set different pricing
	to each account for the same destination
  * voipuser.password column name changed to voipuser.chappassword to describe 
    the purpose of this field better
