    when users dial numbers not found in the tariff table

  * added GnuGk config examples how to use the billing systems with SQLAcct,
    SQLPasswordAuth and SQLAuth modules instead of Radius. It does not provide
    full functionality, like with Radius, but may be enough for some people

  * reject gracefully Access-Requests without Framed-IP-Address attribute
  * better handling of IP only authorization - changed user account binding 
    order - IP only users are searched first, then search by h323id is performed

  * BUGFIX: accounting_update_query changed to not check h323id in order
    to allow IP only authorization
  * BUGFIX: accounting_stop_query changed to not check h323id in order
    to allow IP only authorization

  * added ability to authenticate users only by their IP (ignoring User-Name)

15 Jun 2004 -- zvision
  * BUGFIX: active flag for old voiptariff aparently did not work - all tariffs
    were counted as active
  * Billing unit configurable (previously it was fixed to 60 seconds). Now it is
    possible to even to create tariffs for one-time event billing (initialincrement
    set to 60 and regular increment set 0)
  * Tariff engine redesigned - now a single tariff consists of three 
    components: destination info (prefix), the actual tariff (pricing)
	and an optional tariff group. Now is possible to set different pricing
	to each account for the same destination
  * voipuser.password column name changed to voipuser.chappassword to describe 
    the purpose of this field better
  * Currency precision increased from 2 to 4 decimal places
