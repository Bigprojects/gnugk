Sample configuration for FreeRADIUS server to use with GnuGk prepaid platform
=============================================================================

1. Copy postgresql.conf file to FreeRADIUS configuration directory.

2. Edit radiusd.conf to include postgresql.conf file and enable the sql
   module for authorization and accounting (you can look at the sample 
   radiusd.conf file in this directory).

   IMPORTANT: Do not forget to enable with_cisco_vsa_hack = yes option
   in radiusd.conf file
   
3. Edit postgresql.conf file to contain the proper address of the machine
   that is running voipdb database, a valid login/password, etc.

   (You may need to edit PostgreSQL configuration file pg_hba.conf to accept
   database connections from the FreeRADIUS machine)
   
4. Do not forget to edit clients.conf and append an entry for GnuGk.

5. Reload (or start) FreeRADIUS server.

This has been tested with FreeRADIUS 0.9.x. You can find more info
about FreeRADIUS server at http://www.freeradius.org.
