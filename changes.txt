Changes from 0.11 to 0.12
=========================

- you must have a config file now to set the various new options
  (eg. gatekeeper.ini in the current directory, or set a path on the
  command line with -c)
- support for failover to other gatekeepers
- RAS messages can be forwarded to other gatekeepers
- TCP parameters can be configured in the config file
- what gateway to use on what E.164 prefix can be specified in the
  config file
- overlapped sending: specify in the config file when to send
  "incompleteAddress" on ARQ and collect more digits
- detailed authentication rules which endpoints may register based on
  their IP numbers
- rule based authentication for usage of the status port
- alias rewriting: the gatekeeper has a list of E.164 aliases
  that are replaced by another E.164 number
- many bugfixes...

- the timeToLive filed in RCF can be set on the command line with -l

- more detailed status messages (see GkStatusMsgFmt.html)
  many patches from Henrik Joerring

Most of the changes in this release are donated by folks at MediaWays
(Markus Storm and Torsten Will).
They sent more stuff than I can mention here.


Changes from 0.10 to 0.11
=========================

- many memory leaks fixed
  by Damian Slee
- LRQ implemented
  patch by Ashley Unitt
- accept LRQ as Multicast, too
- when more bandwidth is requested than available we now grant ACF with
  the bandwidth that's still available
  input from Robert Jongbloed
- more attempts for a clean shutdown handling
- status thread accepts commands now (see gkstatus.txt)
  patch by Ashley Unitt
- more detailed status messages (see GkStatusMsgFmt.html)
  input from Henrik Joerring
- general code fixups
  by nils@shkoo.com


Changes from 0.9 to 0.10
========================

- trace messages now use the Pwlib trace facility (use -t or -tt ... to
  turn them on and -o to write to a file)
  patch from Seungoh Jhung
- support for lightweight registration updates
- on shutdown all registered endpoint receive a UnregistrationRequest
- support for gateways: for gateways we only compare the prefix of
  the E.164 address the gateway registered and assume that the gateway
  provides access to the whole address space (needs testing!)
  input from Frank Breitenbach
- new commandline option -h <ip> to specify the ip number the
  gatekeeper binds to. Now you can use IP aliases on Linux and
  start as many gatekeeprs as you want.
  input from Markus Storm
- status messages with ip numbers
  input from Seungoh Jhung
- bugfixes
  from many contributors...


Changes from 0.8 to 0.9
=======================

- gatekeeper routed signaling implemented (only H.225; no H.245, yet)
  provided by Sergio Artero Martinez
- Bugfix: RRQ from Innovaphone IP400 now ok
  input by Markus Storm
- gk sends status messages to all clients connected to TCP port 7000
  (eg. for SNMP agent) - this is experimental and may evolve into
  a full-fledged interface to the gatekkeper
- all mandatory RAS messages implemented
