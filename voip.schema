# A) VoIP User
# 
# A.1) Attributes also used in standard classes. Your LDAP server should know about these.
# 
# NOTE:
# In order to have a unique H.323 ID to avoid registration clashing, we use 
# a user's primary e-mail address as his H.323 ID.
# Neither uids nor cns are guaranteed to be unique.
# Two users with the same uid trying to register with their uid as a H.323 alias would
# result in RRJ for the second user, and he would certainly not understand why !
# For gateways, that address needs to be artificially constructed.
# We use <host>@voip.<yourdomain>. <host> is a DNS name without dots (i.e., the hostname).
# That's SIP-compatible, by the way (Jehova !) :-)
#
# attributetype ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 NAME ( 'mail' 'rfc822Mailbox' )
#   DESC 'RFC1274: RFC822 Mailbox'
#   EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
#   SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
#   SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26{256} )
#
#
# NOTE:
# telephoneNumber defines the prefix(es) and number(s) assigned to gateways
# and terminals, respectively.
# According to RFC 2256, E.123 defines the format to be used for
# the telephoneNumber attribute. See http://www.ngi.org/enum/pub/Draft_Rec_E123.htm
#
# We further refine this definition as follows:
# telephoneNumber: +49 5246 80 ....
#                   cc  ac  sn  ext
#
# Spaces and dots are important. A single space is used to separate the
# country code (cc), area code (ac), subscriber number (sn) and extension (ext)
# from each other. Each dot is a placeholder for a single cipher, i.e. 0-9.
# The above value of telephoneNumber defines the number space for a gateway
# starting with the base number 49524680 and allowing for an extension
# of exactly four ciphers.
# Multiple occurences of the telephoneNumber attribute may be used to define
# further prefixes / subscriber numbers.
# A fully qualified number used to represent terminals would be e.g.
# +49 5246 80 1867

# A.2) Attributes also used in other mediaWays classes. You may
#      need to remove the comment signs for some of them if you do not
#      have the 'mways.schema'-file.
#
# NOTE:
# plaintextPassword contains the user's password in cleartext or
# encrypted with a 2-way mechanism.
# A plaintext password is needed to calculate H.235 hashes.
# The 'userpassword' attribute is usually one-way-encrypted (crypt or SHA-1)
# and therefore cannot be used.
# To avoid storing cleartext passwords here, you may implement your own
# 2-way encryption method. You should denote the used method within the value
# like you do with the userpassword attribute, i.e.
# "plaintextPassword: {3DES}XXXXX" means XXXXX is a triple-DES encrypted password.

# B) LDAP tree structure

# B.1) recommended tree structure
#
# You do not need to setup your LDAP tree like this. It's just a recommendation.
# The exact format of the dn is irrelevant and therefore any existing format
# can be used. 
#
# A common search root for both, the subtree containing all the terminals and
# the subtree containing all the gateways, is assumed. In the following example,
# this common search root is "o=mediaways.net".
# Go with something like OpenLDAP's back-meta if you need to tie multiple servers
# together under a single root.
# To allow for further, LDAP-like representation below this root, entries need not
# be direct childs of the search root. In the following example, "ou=mediaWays"
# is a organizational unit representing the customer "mediaWays". Other ou's like
# "ou=customerX, o=mediaways.net" may exist and contain VoIP entries to be used.

# NOTE: 
# Default values may be stored as attributes to parent nodes, i.e.
# Values stored down the tree override values higher up in the tree.
# Browsing up the tree can stop when encountering top nodes.
# Top nodes are the highest nodes within a subtree that still contain the
# voIPProperty objectclass.


# B.2) Examples
# 
# The following LDAP entry
#
# dn: cn=Markus Storm, ou=mediaWays, o=mediaways.net
# objectclass:       voIPProperty
# mail:              markus.storm@mediaways.net
# telephoneNumber:   +49 5246 80 1867
# telephoneNumber:   +49 5246 80 6867
# plaintextpassword: {3DES}X1Y2Z3
#
# defines a terminal that may register with an H.323 ID of "markus.storm@mediaways.net"
# and E.164 ID of +49 5246 80 1867 and +49 5246 80 6867.
# H.235 is required and triple DES was used to create the encrypted password "X1Y2Z3".
# 

# Residential gateways are referenced by a LDAP-like representation of their DNS name.
# Only the last element needs to be common to both, terminal and gateway subtrees to serve
# as the  search root. The following example represents a gateway.
# It's DNS name tbag-gtso-de01.voip.mediaways.net resolves to IP address 1.2.3.4 .

#
# (Residential) gateways are represented as follows:
#
# dn: dc=tbag-gtso-de01, dc=voip, o=mediaways.net
# objectclass:     voIPProperty
# mail:            tbag-gtso-de01@voip.mediaways.net
# voIPip:          1.2.3.4
# telephoneNumber: +49 5241 80 ....
# telephoneNumber: +49 5241 80 20...
#
# The dn is built of multiple dc parts (domain components) that represent
# the gateway's DNS name. The o=mediaways.net is the search root common to
# both subtrees, the one storing terminal and the other storing gateways.
#
# This gateway is not required to use H.235 but it is authenticated by it's
# packets' source IP address which is 1.2.3.4.
# Calls to +49 5241 80 XXXX and +49 5241 80 20XXX are routed to this gateway
# (X being a single cipher).
#  A Call to e.g. +49 5241 80 21234 is NOT routed to this gateway.
