<sect1>Compiling the Gatekeeper
<p>
Para crear el gatekeeper necesita al menos PWLib 1.5.0 y OpenH323 1.12.0 o superior.
To build the gatekeeper you need at least PWLib 1.5.0 and OpenH323 1.12.0 or later.
La version en desarrollo del gatekeeper normalmente necesita la ultima version disponible de OpenH323.
The development version of the gatekeeper usually needs the
most recent OpenH323 version available.

Orden de compilacion:
Order of compiling:
<enum>
<item>PWLib (release + debug version)
<item>OpenH323
<item>OpenH323 test application (not needed, just to make sure everything works so far)
<item>The Gatekeeper
</enum>

On Unix do a <tt/configure/ and <tt/make debug/ or <tt/make opt/
in the gatekeeper directory to build debug or release version, respectively.
Use <tt/make both/ to build both versions.
Note you have to use GCC 3.3.x or later. The older version may not work.
Good practice is to do a <tt/make debugdepend/ or <tt/make optdepend/
in the gatekeeper directory before starting actual compilation (make debug or
make opt) - these commands build approtiate dependency lists, so after
you will update your sources from CVS, all affected files will get recompiled.
Otherwise you can finish with the Gatekeeper partially compiled with the older
headers and partially with the updated headers - a very bad thing.
On Windows just open and compile the provided project (<tt/gk.dsw/) for
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 7.0 (Visual C++ 5.0 is too old).<newline>

Type <tt/configure --help/ to see a detailed list of all compile time
options. You can use them to enable or disable some features of the gatekeeper.
For example, if you do not need RADIUS just type: <tt/configure --disable-radius/.<newline>

To build the gatekeeper that is statically linked with system and OpenH323 libraries,
<tt/make optnoshared/ or <tt/make debugnoshared/ has to be used.

In order to use the gatekeeper under heavy load, enabling LARGE_FDSET feature
is recommended (configure --with-large-fdset=1024). Most systems also need 
kernel reconfiguration/recompilation in order to allow more than 1024 sockets
to be allocated for a single process. Note that the PWLib library starting
from version 1.5.3 supports a similar feature too, so you can choose between
LARGE_FDSET GnuGk and PWLib implementation. GnuGk native implementation gives
better performance results. Maximum LARGE_FDSET value should be calculated 
based upon predicted maximum sockets usage. A rule of thumb may be:
<tscreen><verb>
MAX_NUMBER_OF_CONCURRENT_CALLS * 10 * 120%

Where:
10 = 2 sockets for Q.931 + 2 sockets for H.245 + 6 sockets for RTP and other stuff
</verb></tscreen>
So for 100 concurrent calls you don't need more than ca. 1024 sockets in the
LARGE_FDSET.

<sect1>Installing the Gatekeeper
<p>
There is no special installation procedure needed.
Just copy the executable to the directory you like
and create a config file for it.
There are several config examples in the <tt>etc/</tt> subdirectory
of source tree. See section <ref id="config" name="Configuration File">
for detailed explanations.

For example, in Linux x86 platform, the optimized executable <tt/gnugk/
is produced in <tt>obj_linux_x86_r/</tt> subdirectory.
You may copy it to <tt>/usr/sbin/</tt>, create a config in
<tt>/etc/gnugk.ini</tt> and start it by
<tscreen><verb>
$ /usr/sbin/gnugk -c /etc/gnugk.ini -o /var/log/gnugk.log -ttt
</verb></tscreen>
See section <ref id="commandline" name="Command Line Options"> for details.

<sect1>Pre-Built Binaries
<p>
If you do not wish to compile the gatekeeper from source,
there are several pre-built `packages' available from
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4797" name="SourceForge">.
Not all versions will be made available as binaries - check what is avilable.

<bf/Tar packages (.tgz or .tar.gz)/<p>
Download the tar file and enter the following command as <tt/root/,
substitute in the name of the file you downloaded.
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar xvzf gnugk-x.x.x.tar
</verb></tscreen>

<bf/Debian packages (.deb)/<p>
Debian includes the gatekeeper as openh323gk package.
You can install it by using the following command as <tt/root/:
<tscreen><verb>
$ apt-get install openh323gk
</verb></tscreen>
