<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::GWPrefixes&rsqb;
<label id="gwprefixes">
<p>
This section configures how dialed E.164 numbers are routed to a specific gateway.

<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt>gw-alias=prefix[:=priority][,prefix[:=priority],...]</tt>
<p>
Note that you must specify the alias of the gateway.
If a gateway has registered with the specified alias, all numbers beginning with
the prefixes are routed to that gateway. Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/
can be used here to match any digit or to disable the prefix.
A priority can be given to each prefix for each gateway (using := syntax),
so that if several gateways match the dialed number, the one
with the highest prefix priority will be selected to route the call (when
the ActivateFailover switch is ON, the call will be routed to all selected
gateways in order of the prefix priority).  A smaller value corresponds to
a higher priority.  Default value is 1.  If the prefix priority
and overlaps the GatewayPriority (see section <ref id="epconfig"
name="[EP::...]">), the prefix priority will be preferred.

In the following example, the gateway "test-gw" will be responsible for
prefixes "02" and "03" with a priority of 3, and for "04" with a priority
of 1.

<tag/Example:/
<tt/test-gw=02,03:=3,04:=1/
</descrip>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::PermanentEndpoints&rsqb;
<p>
In this section you may configure endpoints that don't have RAS support
or that you don't want to be expired. Their records will always
remain in the registration table of the gatekeeper.
However, you can still unregister it via the status port.
Special characters <tt/./ and <tt/!/
can be used with prefixes here to match any digit and disable the prefix.
You may use := syntax to set a prefix priority in the same manner as in <ref id="gwprefixes" name="[RasSrv::GWPrefixes]"> section.
<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt>IP[:port]=alias[,alias,...;prefix[:=priority][,prefix[:=priority]]...]</tt>
<tag/Example:/
For gateway,
<quote/<tt/10.0.1.5=MyGW;009,008:=2,0.7:=3//
For terminal,
<quote/<tt/10.0.1.10:1720=700//
</descrip>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::RRQFeatures&rsqb;
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/AcceptEndpointIdentifier=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Whether to accept <bf/endpointIdentifier/ specified in a full RRQ.

<item><tt/AcceptGatewayPrefixes=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
A gateway can register its prefixes with the gatekeeper by sending
<bf/supportedPrefixes/ in the <bf/terminalType/ field of the RRQ.
This option defines whether to accept the specified prefixes of a gateway.

<item><tt/AcceptMCUPrefixes=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
A MCU can register its prefixes with the gatekeeper by sending 
<bf/supportedPrefixes/ in the <bf/terminalType/ field of the RRQ.
This option defines whether to accept the specified prefixes of a MCU.


<item><tt/OverwriteEPOnSameAddress=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
In some networks an endpoint's IP address may change unexpectedly.  This
may happen when an endpoint is using a PPP connection (e.g. modem or ADSL).
This option defines how to handle a registration request (RRQ) from an IP
address which does not match what we have stored.  The default action is
to reject the request.  With this option enabled the conflicting request
will cause an unregister request (URQ) to be sent for the existing IP
address and the entry to be removed, allowing the endpoint to register
with the new address.

<item><tt/IRQPollCount=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
When the gatekeeper does not receive a keep-alive RRQ from an endpoint
within the TimeToLive time period, it sends an IRQ message to "poll" the endpoint
and check if it is alive. After IRQPollCount messages are sent and no reply
is received, the endpoint is unregistered. To disable this feature (and unregister
endpoints immediately after TimeToLive timeout), set this variable to 0.
IRQ poll interval is 60 seconds.

<item><tt/SupportDynamicIP=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/0/<newline>
<p>
When the IP address of an endpoint changes, the gatekeeper can maintain registration. 
This will force the EP to fully re-register if its IP address changes. 

<item><tt>AccHTTPLink=https://billing.mysite.com?account=%a&amp;password=%p</tt><newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
You can assign a URL for clients to access to view billing information.
If using PacPhone you can also add wildcards for the client to use so the clients 
H323ID and password can be used to directly access their account information.
    %a - H323ID   %p - password 

<item><tt>AliasTypeFilter=terminal;h323id,dialeddigits</tt><newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Use this setting where endpoints send multiple H225_AliasAddress and some Aliases are
shared across multiple registrations. You can filter out the shared alias types for
any given endpoint type. The registrations will keep all alias types listed in the
filter setting and remove all others.
You must have separate AliasTypeFilter entries for each endpoint type.
Valid endpoint types are: gatekeeper, gateway, mcu and terminal.
Valid filters are: h323id, dialeddigits, url, transport, email and partynumber.
NOTE: If no alias is found that match the filter then all aliases are registered.
</itemize>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::ARQFeatures&rsqb;
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/ArjReasonRouteCallToGatekeeper=1/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
If enabled, the gatekeeper rejects an answered ARQ without a pre-existing
CallRec found in the CallTable by reason <bf/routeCallToGatekeeper/
in routed mode.
The endpoint shall release the call immediately and re-send call Setup
to the gatekeeper.

<item><tt/RemoveTrailingChar=#/<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Specify the trailing character to be removed in <bf/destinationInfo/.
For example, if your endpoint incorrectly contains a termination character
such as `&num;' in <bf/destinationInfo/ you may remove it with this option.

<item><tt/RoundRobinGateways=0/<newline>
Default: <tt/1/<newline>
<p>
Enable/disable round-robin gateway selection if more than one gateway
matches a dialed number. If disabled, the first available gateway will be selected.
Otherwise, subsequent calls will be sent to gateways in round-robin fashion.

</itemize>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::AssignedAlias&rsqb;
<p>
This allows the assigning of aliases to endpoints as they register, allowing them to 
set their fully qualified E.164 or URI addresses.

<descrip>
<tag/Example:/
<verb>
[RasSrv::AssignedAlias]
1234=3323465777,me@mysite.com 
</verb>
</descrip>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;AssignedAliases::SQL&rsqb;
<p>
This section configures GnuGk to read the assigned aliases from a database.
You can use the same database parameters as defined in <ref id="sqlpasswordauth" name="[SQLPasswordAuth]">.

<itemize>
<item><tt/Query=SELECT .../<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Defines the SQL query used to retrieve the assigned aliases from the database.

One parameter is defined:
<itemize>
<item><tt/%u/ - endpoint alias
</itemize>
<p>
Sample query string:
<tscreen><verb>
SELECT assignedalias FROM users WHERE alias = '%u' AND active
</verb></tscreen>

</itemize>

<sect1>Section &lsqb;RasSrv::AssignedGatekeeper&rsqb;
<p>
This allows the assigning of a gatekeeper based upon the H323ID or the
apparent source IP address of the registering endpoint.
The received H323ID in the GRQ is checked to see if it has a prefix
for an assigned gatekeeper or the IP is in a range of an assigned
gatekeeper.
The endpoint is then advised in the GCF to register with that gatekeeper.
You may have multiple gatekeepers for a specific prefix.  The first
is assigned as the primary and others are then the alternates.
(requires H.323v6)

<descrip>
<tag/Examples:/
<verb>
[RasSrv::AssignedGKs]
;; For Endpoint with H323ID starting with 01234
01234=x.x.x.x:1719
;; For Endpoints in the range of 195.71.129.0/24 or 195.71.131.0/24
^195\.71\.(129|131)\.[0-9]+$=x.x.x.x:1719
</verb>
</descrip>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;AssignedGatekeepers::SQL&rsqb;
<p>
This section allows <htmlurl url="http://www.gnugk.org/" name="GnuGk"> to read the assigned gatekeepers from a database.
You can use the same database parameters as defined in <ref id="sqlpasswordauth" name="[SQLPasswordAuth]">.

<itemize>
<item><tt/Query=SELECT .../<newline>
Default: <tt>N/A</tt><newline>
<p>
Defines the SQL query used to retrieve the assigned gatekeepers from the database.

Two parameters are defined:
<itemize>
<item><tt/%u/ - endpoint alias
<item><tt/%i/ - endpoint IP
</itemize>
<p>
Sample query string:
<tscreen><verb>
SELECT assignedgatekeeper FROM users WHERE alias = '%u' AND active
</verb></tscreen>

</itemize>


<sect1>Section &lsqb;NATedEndpoints&rsqb;
<p>
The gatekeeper can automatically detect whether an endpoint is behind NAT.
However, if the detection fails, you can specify it manually in this section.

<descrip>
<tag/Format:/
<tt/alias=true,yes,1,.../
<tag/Example:/
Specify an endpoint with alias 601 is behind NAT.
<quote/<tt/601=true//
</descrip>
