Format of the current CDR:

 0) Delimeter
    The field delimeter is the vertical bar '|'
    The record delieter is the linefeed, either '\r\n' (M$-OS) or '\n'
    (POSIX OS). 

 1) Tag 'CDR'
    [CDR]
    Simply the literal tag 'CDR'. 

 2) Call Number
    [4]
    Integer value, local to gatekeeper

 3) Call Identifier (guid)
    [56 34 34 34 34 ef 14 00 2b 21 29 29 77 c2 f7 cc]
    Global H.323 call identifier in hexadecimal representation

 4) Call Duration
    [26.799000]
    Fixed point representation in seconds with millisecond resolution

 5) Call Start 
    [Wed, 13 Mar 2002 17:39:41 +0100]
    Textual time representation of the beginning of the billable call as
    specified in 'UseCDRFormat'-tag in the ini-file. Defaults to RFC
    1123 (with numerical time zone information) in local time. With the
    'UseUTCinCDR'-tag the time zone may be switched to Universal Time
    Coordinates (UTC).

 6) Call End
    [Wed, 13 Mar 2002 17:40:07 +0100]
    Textual time representation of the end of the billable call. Format
    as specified for (5) Call Start.

 7) Calling Endpoint (A) as dotted decimal
    [195.71.100.56:1720]

    Internet Protocol Address and Port of calling endpoint in dotted
    decimal notation. The Port part is seperated from the Address part
    by a colon (:).

 8) Calling Endpoint (A) as Endpoint Identifier
    [5632_gk3]
    H225 Endpoint Identifier of calling endpoint

 9) Called Endpoint (B) as dotted decimal
    [195.71.100.3:20000]
    Internet Protocol Address and Port of called endpoint in dotted
    decimal notation. . The Port part is seperated from the Address part
    by a colon (:).

10) Called Endpoint (B) as Endpoint Identifier
    [5631_gk3]
    H225 Endpoint Identifier of called endpoint

11) Destination Information
    [00495246801581:dialedDigits]

    H225_AdmissionRequest
	m_destinationInfo
	H225_ArrayOf_AliasAddress m_destinationInfo;

12) Source Information
    [49524680321:dialedDigits=49524680321:h323_ID=49524680321:dialedDigits=49524680321:h323_ID]

    H225_AdmissionRequest
	m_destinationInfo
	H225_ArrayOf_AliasAddress m_srcInfo

13) Reporting Gatekeeper's name
    [martinf-GK]
    Name as specified in ini-file by 'Name'-tag. This is the possibility
    to discriminate between two GKs if the CDRs are merged into one
    file/stream.
