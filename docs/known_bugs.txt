Known bugs:
* the Reoute status port command works unreliable when used with argument CALLED,
  this also affects the MakeCall command when TransferMethod=Reroute is set
* H.245 sockets are bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), Home config option is ignored
  which may cause problems on multihomed hosts (virtual servers)
* a race condition occurs when both endpoints try to establish H.245 connection
  in H.245 routed mode - this can cause a call to fail
* authentication/accounting modules do not work fine for gatekeeper forwarded 
  calls (ForwardOnFacility=1), it is recommended to disable this flag
* on BSD systems using PTLib 2.11.0 long-form commandline arguments don't work (eg. --strict)
