Known bugs:
* a race condition occurs when both endpoints try to establish H.245 connection
  in H.245 routed mode - this makes a call to fail
* authentication/accounting modules do not work fine for gatekeeper forwarded 
  calls (ForwardOnFacility=1), it is recommended to disable this flag
* PostgreSQL driver for SQLxxx modules does not reconnect to the database
  if the connection is lost until gatekeeper reload
* the gatekeeper does not try to bind a socket again if a Q.931/H.245/T.120 port
  is already in use, therefore some calls may fail under specific circumstances
