How to deal with changing IP numbers
====================================

More and more users enjoy the bandwidth of cable modems and other 
dial-up broadband services. One problem many users have to deal 
with in these setups is, that their IP number is changing from time
to time.

Changing IP number for endpoint, stable IP for gatekeeper
---------------------------------------------------------

When the gatekeeper maintains a static IP number and only the
endpoints receives a new IP number, the best way would be for
the endpoint to unregister it's alias (at best from the old IP
number, but this will probably also work from the new one) and
then re-register with the same alias from the new IP number.

If your endpoint doesn't do that and you have access to the
OpenH323 Gatekeeper status port, you can write a small script
that connects to the gatekeeper and unregisters all endpoints
on the old IP number ("unregisterip 1.2.3.4").
Most endpoint will try to re-register automatically. If the
enpoint uses the new IP number for the reregistration everything
is well.
